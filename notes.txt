[Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
    git checkout master
    git fetch origin
    git reset --hard origin/master

This switches the repo to the master branch, pulls the latest commits and
 resets the repo's local copy of master to match the latest version.

    git checkout -b new-feature
checks out a branch called new-feature based on master, and the -b flag tells
 Git to create the branch if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

    git push -u origin new-feature
pushes new-feature to the central repository (origin), and the -u flag adds it
 as a remote tracking branch. After setting up the tracking branch, git push
 can be invoked without any parameters to automatically push the new-feature
 branch to the central repository

 Then pull request to master
